<h6>Pseudo code</h6>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b><u>FlowChart:</u></b> It is visual representation of program using diagrams amd shapes having a fixed meaning.<br/>
    Example : In a flow chart the <b>Eclipse</b> denotes the starting and end of the program.<br/>
    <b><u>Parallelogram</u></b> denotes the input or output statement. <br/>
    <b><u>Rectangle</u></b> denotes the calculation or some arthimatic operations.<br />
    <b><u>Rhombus</u></b> denotes the decision or comparison, etc.<br />
    <b>Note : There is no symbol or shape for loops but decision shape can be used to make loop.</b> <br />

    <b>PseudoCode: </b> It is general instructions without any syntax but once it is written it can be easily converted into a code.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Programming Languages </b> are special lamguages which can be conberted into computer understandable format which is written in a fix format known as syntax.
  </li>
  <li>
    We know that a computer can perform calculations and other action better than human beings but we can't give instuctions directly to computer as it only understand 0 and 1. so we write a program in a human understandable format and then a program convert it into the computer understandable program this program is known as compiler.

<h6>Pattern in cpp</h6>
<ul>
  <li>
     - <b>First analyse the pattern</b>, see the number of rows and the characters how its printing in what pattern<br />
     - <b><u>Create a EQUATION (relation)</b> between the number of columns using the number of rows</u> <br/>
     - Check all iterations<br/>
     - Code while loops, dont forget to add base statements <br/>
