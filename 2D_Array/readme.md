# 2 D array 

These are linear array only but we are visualizing it as a 2d array, this can be done using a mathematical function which would tell the index of elements stored.
For ex. A 3x3 matrix : 9 elements (0-8) , formula : Nc*r + c (Nc- number of column): 0th row 1st column : 0+1 = 1, 1st row 1st column : 3 +1 = 4
