# Selection Sort
Idea: 
- traverese the array in a for loop for index.
- For each index find the least value from the rest of the array and replace it
(We traverse from 0 to n-1 and take it as the index where the next least value is put.We traverse in rest of the arrat and find the least value and replace in with the value at index)
