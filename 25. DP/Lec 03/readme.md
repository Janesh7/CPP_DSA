**VVVIMP Minimum Number of Coins to Make a Denomination:**

This problem involves finding the minimum number of coins required to make a given denomination value, given a set of coin denominations. Let's explore various approaches to solving this problem.

**1. Naive Recursive Approach:**

In the naive recursive approach, we consider each coin denomination and explore all possible combinations to find the minimum number of coins required. It involves a recursive exploration of each possible path.

The time complexity of the naive recursive approach is exponential because it explores all possible combinations, leading to redundant calculations.

**2. Memoization (Top-Down Approach):**

Memoization is a technique that involves caching the results of expensive function calls and reusing the cached results when the same inputs occur again. In the context of the coin change problem, it helps avoid redundant calculations by storing the results of subproblems.

The memoization approach optimizes the recursive approach by eliminating redundant calculations, thereby improving the time complexity to O(n*amount), where 'n' is the number of denominations and 'amount' is the given target amount. The space complexity is O(amount) for the memoization array.

**3. Tabulation (Bottom-Up Approach):**

Tabulation is an iterative approach that involves building the DP table from the base cases up to the target amount. It avoids the recursive overhead and is often more efficient for problems where the order of solving subproblems does not matter.

The tabulation approach also has a time complexity of O(n*amount) and a space complexity of O(amount) for the DP array.

**Space Optimization Approach:**

Space optimization can be challenging for this problem because we need to track the minimum number of coins for each possible amount. Simplifying the DP array into a 1D array or implementing a rolling DP array might not be practical, as it can lead to the loss of necessary information about subproblem solutions.

Given the nature of the problem, space optimization may not be a feasible or practical approach.

In summary, while the recursive approach provides a straightforward solution, it suffers from redundant calculations, resulting in exponential time complexity. Memoization and tabulation offer more efficient solutions by eliminating redundancy, and space optimization may not be suitable for this particular problem due to the complexity of the subproblems.

**1. Naive Recursive Approach:**

In the naive recursive approach, we solve the problem by considering all possible combinations of coins and choosing the one with the minimum number of coins. This approach involves a lot of redundant calculations.

**Example:**
```cpp
int minCoins(int denominations[], int n, int amount) {
    // Base case: If the amount is 0, no coins are needed.
    if (amount == 0) return 0;
    
    int result = INT_MAX;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (denominations[i] <= amount) {
            int subproblem = minCoins(denominations, n, amount - denominations[i]);
            
            // If the subproblem solution is not INT_MAX (i.e., feasible), consider it.
            if (subproblem != INT_MAX) {
                result = min(result, subproblem + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

**Time Complexity (Naive Recursive):** Exponential, O(2^n), where 'n' is the amount.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) due to the recursive call stack.

**2. Memoization (Top-Down Approach):**

To optimize the naive approach, we use memoization to store the results of subproblems in a cache and avoid redundant calculations.

**Example:**
```cpp
int minCoinsMemo(int denominations[], int n, int amount, vector<int>& dp) {
    if (amount == 0) return 0;
    if (dp[amount] != -1) return dp[amount];
    
    int result = INT_MAX;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (denominations[i] <= amount) {
            int subproblem = minCoinsMemo(denominations, n, amount - denominations[i], dp);
            
            if (subproblem != INT_MAX) {
                result = min(result, subproblem + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    
    dp[amount] = result;
    return result;
}
```

**Time Complexity (Memoization):** O(n*amount), where 'n' is the number of denominations.
**Space Complexity:** O(amount) for the DP array.

**3. Tabulation (Bottom-Up Approach):**

In the tabulation approach, we start with the smallest subproblems and iteratively build up to the final problem, filling a DP table.

**Example:**
```cpp
int minCoinsTabulation(int denominations[], int n, int amount) {
    vector<int> dp(amount + 1, INT_MAX);
    dp[0] = 0;
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= amount; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (denominations[j] <= i) {
                int subproblem = dp[i - denominations[j]];
                if (subproblem != INT_MAX) {
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], subproblem + 1);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[amount];
}
```

**Time Complexity (Tabulation):** O(n*amount), where 'n' is the number of denominations.
**Space Complexity:** O(amount) for the DP array.

**Space Optimization Approach:**

**In simple terms we need x variables to solve this which is not feasible**
The space optimization approach can be challenging for this problem because we need to track the minimum number of coins for each possible amount. Using space optimization techniques such as a 1D array or a rolling DP array may not be feasible without losing information about subproblem solutions. Therefore, space optimization is often not practical for this problem.

In summary, the memoization and tabulation approaches are the most efficient ways to solve the "Minimum Number of Coins to Make a Denomination" problem, as they avoid redundant calculations and have a time complexity of O(n*amount), where 'n' is the number of denominations, and 'amount' is the given denomination value. The naive recursive approach is exponential and should be avoided for large inputs. Space optimization is typically not feasible for this problem due to its requirements.
