**Cutting Rod into Segments of Given Lengths:**

The problem involves finding the maximum number of pieces that a rod of length 'n' can be cut into, where the cuts can only be made at specified lengths x, y, and z. Let's explore different approaches to solve this problem.

**1. Naive Recursive Approach:**

The naive approach involves considering all possible combinations of cuts and recursively finding the maximum number of segments. We explore all possible cases by either making a cut of length x, y, or z, and then recursively finding the maximum for the remaining length.

**We r trying to solve by recursion if we dont have a segment(x,y,z) ie n-x/y/z .. so we have to return + 1 as we have to consider the current segment x/y/z ie is why we r doing +1**

**if we get negative its not possible .. if we get 0 that means the segment cut is possible we return 0.. we r adding +1 in call back**
**Example:**
```cpp
int maxPieces(int n, int x, int y, int z) {
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    if (n < 0) return -1;
    int res = max({maxPieces(n-x, x, y, z), maxPieces(n-y, x, y, z), maxPieces(n-z, x, y, z)});
    if (res == -1) return -1;
    return res + 1;
}
```

**Time Complexity (Naive Recursive):** Exponential, O(3^n).
**Space Complexity:** O(n) due to the recursive call stack.

**2. Memoization (Top-Down Approach):**

To optimize the naive approach, we use memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations. By caching the results, we can prevent the need for recalculating subproblems.

**Example:**
```cpp
int maxPiecesMemo(int n, int x, int y, int z, vector<int>& dp) {
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    if (n < 0) return -1;
    if (dp[n] != -1) return dp[n];
    int res = max({maxPiecesMemo(n-x, x, y, z, dp), maxPiecesMemo(n-y, x, y, z, dp), maxPiecesMemo(n-z, x, y, z, dp)});
    if (res == -1) return dp[n] = -1;
    return dp[n] = res + 1;
}
```

**Time Complexity (Memoization):** O(n).
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for the memoization array.

**3. Tabulation (Bottom-Up Approach):**

The tabulation approach involves building the DP table from the base case up to the desired length, filling in the maximum number of segments that can be obtained for each length.

**Example:**
```cpp
int maxPiecesTabulation(int n, int x, int y, int z) {
    vector<int> dp(n + 1, -1);
    dp[0] = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (i - x >= 0) dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - x]);
        if (i - y >= 0) dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - y]);
        if (i - z >= 0) dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - z]);
        if (dp[i] != -1) dp[i]++;
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

**Time Complexity (Tabulation):** O(n).
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for the DP array.

By applying the memoization and tabulation approaches, we can efficiently solve the problem of cutting a rod into segments of given lengths, avoiding redundant calculations and achieving a linear time complexity.
