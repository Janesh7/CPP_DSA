**Maximum Sum of Non-Adjacent Elements:**

This problem involves finding the maximum sum of elements in an array such that no two elements are adjacent. Let's explore the different approaches to solve this problem.

**Approach:**

We can use the concept of dynamic programming to efficiently solve this problem. One way is to use the recursive approach, where we consider two cases for each element: including the current element or excluding it. We take the maximum of these two cases and move forward recursively.

**Recursive Tree for the Maximum Sum Problem:**

Consider an array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

```
             f(5)
      inc /       \ exc
      f(3)          f(4)
     /   \         /    \
   f(1) f(2)     f(2)  f(3)
```

**NOTE: We can see that at any number we can include that or exclude that**
**for include - we need to go 2 index back as we have included it and cant include the prev.. ie why n-2**
**for exclude - we need to go an index back as we r not including this and should include the prev ele.. ie why n-1** 

**Explanation:**

The recursive approach explores two cases at each step:
1. Include the current element and recur for the elements that are at least two positions away.
2. Exclude the current element and recur for the next element.

We choose the maximum sum obtained from these two cases.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

The time complexity of the recursive approach is exponential, O(2^n), where 'n' is the size of the array, due to the repeated function calls and redundant calculations.

The space complexity is O(n) due to the recursive call stack.

**Three Approaches to Solve the Problem:**

1. **Naive Recursive Approach:**
```cpp
int maxSum(vector<int>& nums, int i) {
    if (i < 0) return 0;
    return max(maxSum(nums, i-2) + nums[i], maxSum(nums, i-1));
}
```
**Time Complexity:** O(2^n)
**Space Complexity:** O(n) due to the recursive call stack.

2. **Memoization (Top-Down Approach):**
```cpp
int maxSumMemo(vector<int>& nums, int i, vector<int>& dp) {
    if (i < 0) return 0;
    if (dp[i] != -1) return dp[i];
    dp[i] = max(maxSumMemo(nums, i-2, dp) + nums[i], maxSumMemo(nums, i-1, dp));
    return dp[i];
}
```
**Time Complexity:** O(n)
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for the memoization array.

3. **Tabulation (Bottom-Up Approach):**
```cpp
int maxSumTabulation(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    if (n == 1) return nums[0];
    vector<int> dp(n);
    dp[0] = nums[0];
    dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1]);
    for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        dp[i] = max(dp[i-2] + nums[i], dp[i-1]);
    }
    return dp[n-1];
}
```
**Time Complexity:** O(n)
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for the DP array.
