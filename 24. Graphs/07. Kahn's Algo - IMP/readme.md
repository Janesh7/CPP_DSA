**Kahn's Algorithm for Topological Sorting (Using BFS)**

Kahn's Algorithm is an efficient method to perform topological sorting on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) using Breadth-First Search (BFS). Here's a detailed explanation of the algorithm along with its pseudocode, time complexity, and space complexity.

**Remove a node with 0 in degree .. recalculate the indegrees and continue till no more nodes left**

**Algorithm Overview:**

1. Initialize an array `inDegree` to store the in-degrees of all vertices, initially set to 0.
2. Calculate the in-degrees of all vertices by traversing the graph. For each directed edge `(u, v)`, increment `inDegree[v]` by 1.
3. Initialize a queue `q` to store nodes with in-degree 0.
4. Add all vertices with in-degree 0 to the queue `q`.
5. Initialize an empty list or stack to store the topological ordering (result).
6. While the queue `q` is not empty:
   - Dequeue a vertex `u` from `q`.
   - Add `u` to the topological ordering (result).
   - For each neighbor `v` of `u`, decrement `inDegree[v]` by 1.
   - If `inDegree[v]` becomes 0 after decrementing, enqueue `v`.
7. If the size of the topological ordering list is equal to the number of vertices, return the topological order as it's a valid topological sorting.
8. If the size is less than the number of vertices, it means there is a cycle in the graph, and topological sorting is not possible (graph is not a DAG).

**Data Structures Used:**

- `inDegree[]`: An array to store the in-degrees of vertices.
- `queue q`: A queue to perform BFS.
- Topological Ordering (Result): A list or stack to store the sorted order.

**Algorithm Complexity:**

- Time Complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices, and E is the number of edges.
- Space Complexity: O(V), where V is the number of vertices.

**Pseudocode in C++:**

```cpp
vector<int> topologicalSort(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
    int V = graph.size(); // Number of vertices
    vector<int> inDegree(V, 0);
    
    // Calculate in-degrees for all vertices
    for (int u = 0; u < V; ++u) {
        for (int v : graph[u]) {
            inDegree[v]++;
        }
    }

    queue<int> q;
    for (int u = 0; u < V; ++u) {
        if (inDegree[u] == 0) {
            q.push(u); // Enqueue vertices with in-degree 0
        }
    }

    vector<int> topologicalOrder;
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int u = q.front();
        q.pop();
        topologicalOrder.push_back(u); // Add u to the topological order

        // Decrement in-degrees of neighbors and enqueue if in-degree becomes 0
        for (int v : graph[u]) {
            inDegree[v]--;
            if (inDegree[v] == 0) {
                q.push(v);
            }
        }
    }

    // Check for cycle (if the size of topological order is less than V)
    if (topologicalOrder.size() < V) {
        // Graph contains a cycle
        return {};
    }

    return topologicalOrder;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The algorithm starts by calculating the in-degrees of all vertices.
- Vertices with no incoming edges (in-degree = 0) are enqueued.
- BFS is performed, dequeuing vertices and updating in-degrees.
- If the size of the result list equals the number of vertices, it's a valid topological order. If not, there's a cycle in the graph.
- The algorithm detects cycles because nodes with in-degrees remaining greater than 0 cannot be enqueued.
- If a cycle is detected, an empty list is returned to indicate that topological sorting is not possible.

Kahn's Algorithm is a robust method for topological sorting and cycle detection in DAGs.
