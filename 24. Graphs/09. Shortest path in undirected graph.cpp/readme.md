**Problem: Shortest Path in an Undirected Graph**

**Algorithm Overview:**
- We are given an undirected graph and need to find the shortest path from a source vertex to a destination vertex using BFS.
- The BFS algorithm helps in exploring vertices in layers, making it suitable for finding the shortest path.

**C++ Pseudocode:**

```cpp
// Perform BFS to find the shortest path
vector<int> shortestPathBFS(int source, int destination) {
    vector<int> parent(n, -1);
    queue<int> q;
    q.push(source);
    parent[source] = source;

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int current = q.front();
        q.pop();

        if (current == destination) {
            break; // Shortest path found
        }

        for (int neighbor : graph[current]) {
            if (parent[neighbor] == -1) {
                q.push(neighbor);
                parent[neighbor] = current;
            }
        }
    }

    if (parent[destination] == -1) {
        // No path exists
        return vector<int>();
    }

    vector<int> shortestPath;
    int current = destination;
    while (current != source) {
        shortestPath.push_back(current);
        current = parent[current];
    }
    shortestPath.push_back(source);

    reverse(shortestPath.begin(), shortestPath.end());

    return shortestPath;
}

```

**Time Complexity:**
- The time complexity of the BFS algorithm is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices, and E is the number of edges in the graph.

**Space Complexity:**
- The space complexity is O(V) due to the queue and parent vector.

**Important Points to Remember:**
1. BFS explores vertices in layers, which makes it suitable for finding the shortest path.
2. Initialize a parent vector to keep track of the path from the source to each vertex.
3. If the destination vertex is reached during BFS, backtrack from the destination to the source using the parent vector to construct the shortest path.
4. Reverse the path vector to get the correct order from source to destination.
