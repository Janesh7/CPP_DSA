**Problem: Find Shortest Path in a Weighted DAG**

**Algorithm Overview:**
- We are given a weighted directed acyclic graph (DAG) and need to find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices.
- The approach involves topological sorting and dynamic programming (use linear ordering and then update the distance array) to efficiently find the shortest paths in a DAG.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <list>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <queue>
#include <climits>

using namespace std;

// Define the weighted DAG using an adjacency list
unordered_map<int, list<pair<int, int>>> graph;
int V; // Number of vertices

vector<int> topologicalSort() {
    vector<int> inDegree(V, 0);
    for (auto& kv : graph) {
        for (auto& edge : kv.second) {
            inDegree[edge.first]++;
        }
    }

    queue<int> q;
    for (int i = 0; i < V; ++i) {
        if (inDegree[i] == 0) {
            q.push(i);
        }
    }

    vector<int> topoOrder;
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int u = q.front();
        q.pop();
        topoOrder.push_back(u);

        for (auto& edge : graph[u]) {
            int v = edge.first;
            inDegree[v]--;
            if (inDegree[v] == 0) {
                q.push(v);
            }
        }
    }

    return topoOrder;
}

vector<int> shortestPathDAG(int source) {
    vector<int> topoOrder = topologicalSort();
    vector<int> dist(V, INT_MAX);
    dist[source] = 0;

    for (int u : topoOrder) {
        if (dist[u] != INT_MAX) {
            for (auto& edge : graph[u]) {
                int v = edge.first;
                int weight = edge.second;
                if (dist[u] + weight < dist[v]) {
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + weight;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return dist;
}

int main() {
    // Initialize the graph and other variables
    // ...

    int source;
    cin >> source;

    vector<int> shortestDistances = shortestPathDAG(source);

    cout << "Shortest distances from source " << source << " are:";
    for (int i = 0; i < V; ++i) {
        cout << " " << i << ": " << shortestDistances[i];
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
1. We first perform a topological sort to get a linear ordering of vertices in the DAG. This ordering ensures that we process vertices in a way that respects the direction of edges.

2. Initialize a distance array `dist` with initially all values set to infinity (`INT_MAX`), except for the source vertex, which is set to 0. This array will keep track of the shortest distances from the source to all other vertices.

3. Traverse the vertices in topological order and update the `dist` array as follows:
   - For each vertex `u`, if `dist[u]` is not infinity (i.e., **it has been reached from the source**), update the distances to its adjacent vertices `v` if a shorter path is found.

**Time Complexity:**
- The topological sort takes O(V + E) time in a DAG.
- The updating of distances takes O(V + E) time in the worst case.
- So, the overall time complexity is O(V + E).

**Space Complexity:**
- The space complexity is O(V) for storing the `dist` and `topoOrder` vectors.

**Important Points to Remember:**
1. A DAG is a directed acyclic graph with no cycles.
2. Topological sorting provides a linear ordering of vertices.
3. Initialize distances with infinity and set the source distance to 0.
4. Update distances as you traverse vertices in topological order.
5. The result is a vector of shortest distances from the source to all other vertices.
