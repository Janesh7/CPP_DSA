# Stack

- LIFO : Last in first out
- example plates in a restruant

- Operations: push, pop || and peek(see the top element), isEmpty

- STL to create a stack

```
stack<type> s;
s.push();
s.pop();
s.top();
s.empty();
```

- Every operation in O(1)

Stacks can be implemented using

- arrays
- Linked List

In arrays the class looks like:

public:
        **int *arr;**
        int top;
        int size;

    // behaviour
    Stack(int size) {
        this -> size = size;
        **arr = new int[size];**
        top = -1;
    }

# Questions

**IMPORTANT POINTS TO NOTE**

- **Recursion is very useful in stack question.. Also STORE EACH VALUE IN EACH STEP AND LATER PUT IT BACK**
- **When we r using s.top() for anything.. do remember to add !s.empty() (stack not empty condition) otherwise it gives an exception**


## Insert at bottom

- Done using recursion
**Steps:**
- Base case: if the stack is empty insert the given element into the stack
- otherwise store the top value and pop the top
- give recursive call
- push back the stored element



## Reverse a stack

- Done using recursion
**Steps:**
- Store the top element of the stack
- recursive call on remaining
- while coming back(after recursive) DO - INSERT AT BOTTOM ALGO

**TC: O(n^2)** , can do in o(n) using extra space.



## Sort the stack

- Done using recursion
**Steps**
- base case: if stack is empty.. just return
- Store the top element of the stack
- recursive call on remaining
- while coming back(after recursive) DO - SORTED INSERT algo ie .. when we add the element we make sure the stack is sorted

### SORTED INSERT

- base case: Find an element which is smaller than the given element or the stack is empty 
**NOTE:** while checking the top of the stack for the condition(element is smaller than the top element) do ADD THE !s.empty() part otherwise throws an exception 
- insert the given element and while going back just add back the popped elements in stack




## Redundent brackets
- Ex. ((a+b)) has redundant brackets .. whereas (a*b+(a+B)) doesnt have any redn brackets
**LOGIC**
- All brackets should have an operator in them
APPROACH-

- Iterate over the string using for
- If the char is an open bracket or an operator -> push in stack
else would be a closing bracket or an English alphabet
- we should consider the closing brackets.. 
- if there is a operator between these brackets .. it means no redundant brackets 

**TC: O(N)**




## Minimum reversals for a valid bracket
Here  we have to make minimum changes in the given expression so the braces becomes valid
**Approach**
- if str length is odd .. return false
- so if we remove all the valid braces from the string we remain with
    - all open braces {{{{{{{{
    - all close braces }}}}}}}}
    - mismatched braces }}}}}{{{{{{
    

We use the below expression to find the min changes which is 
**(a+1)/2 + (b+1)/2** where a and b r number of }, { resp

**IMP: note that its int(a+1)/2 and int(b+1)/2 while computing**
Ex. {{{{
        (4+1)/2 + (0+1)/2 = 5/2 + 1/2= 2 + 0 = 2

    }}}}
        (4+1)/2 + (0+1)/2 = 5/2 + 1/2 = 2 

    }}}{{{
        (3+1)/2 + (3+1)/2 = 4
    CHANGED TO: {}{}{}, with change bit of 0,2,3,5.

    }}}}{{{{
        (4+1)/2 + (4+1)/2 = 5/2 + 5/2 = 4
    CHANGED TO: {}{}{}{} changed 
    

**Implementing Queue using Stack:**

To implement a queue using a stack, we can use two stacks. One stack will serve as the main storage for elements, and the other stack will be used temporarily for enqueue and dequeue operations.

Here's how the queue operations can be implemented:

1. **Enqueue Operation:**
   - Simply push the new element onto the main stack.

2. **Dequeue Operation:**
   - If the second stack is empty, transfer all elements from the first stack to the second stack while popping them.
   - Pop the top element from the second stack and return it.

3. **Front Operation:**
   - If the second stack is empty, transfer all elements from the first stack to the second stack while popping them.
   - Return the top element of the second stack without popping.

4. **Empty Operation:**
   - Return whether both stacks are empty.
