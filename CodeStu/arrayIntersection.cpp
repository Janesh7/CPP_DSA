// Problem Statement
// You are given two arrays 'A' and 'B' of size 'N' and 'M' respectively. Both these arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order. You have to find the intersection of these two arrays.
// Intersection of two arrays is an array that consists of all the common elements occurring in both arrays.
// Note :
// 1. The length of each array is greater than zero.
// 2. Both the arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order.
// 3. The output should be in the order of elements that occur in the original arrays.
// 4. If there is no intersection present then return an empty array.

// Basic approach:

using namespace std;
vector<int> findArrayIntersection(vector<int> &arr1, int n, vector<int> &arr2, int m)
{
	int i = 0, j = 0;
    vector<int> ans;
    while(i<n && j<m) {
    
    if(arr1[i]==arr2[j])
    {
    	ans.push_back(arr1[i]);
        i++;
        j++;
    }
    else if (arr1[i] < arr2[j]) {
  		i++;
    }
    else
    {
    	j++;
    }
    
    }
    return ans;
}
