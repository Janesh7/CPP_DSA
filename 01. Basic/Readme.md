<h2>Pseudo code</h2>

    <b>FlowChart:</b> It is visual representation of program using diagrams amd shapes having a fixed meaning.<br/>
    Example : In a flow chart the <b>Eclipse</b> denotes the starting and end of the program.<br/>
    <b>Parallelogram</b> denotes the input or output statement. <br/>
    <b>Rectangle</b> denotes the calculation or some arthimatic operations.<br />
    <b>Rhombus</b> denotes the decision or comparison, etc.<br />
    <b>Note : There is no symbol or shape for loops but decision shape can be used to make loop.</b> <br />

    <b>PseudoCode: </b> It is general instructions without any syntax but once it is written it can be easily converted into a code.

  <li>
    <b>Programming Languages </b> are special lamguages which can be conberted into computer understandable format which is written in a fix format known as syntax.
  </li>
  <li>
    We know that a computer can perform calculations and other action better than human beings but we can't give instuctions directly to computer as it only understand 0 and 1. so we write a program in a human understandable format and then a program convert it into the computer understandable program this program is known as compiler.

<h6>********************************************</h6>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> ADD these 3 lines to ur code for increased performance

**#pragma GCC optimize("Ofast")**
**static auto _ = [] () {ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);cin.tie(nullptr);cout.tie(nullptr);return 0;}();**

<b>ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    cout.tie(nullptr);</b>

<h2>Pattern in cpp</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
     - <b>First analyse the pattern</b>, see the number of rows and the characters how its printing in what pattern<br />
     - <b>Create a EQUATION (relation)</b> between the number of columns using the number of rows <br/>
     - Check all iterations<br/>
     - Code while loops, dont forget to add base statements <br/>

<h2>Bitwise Operators</h2>
<ul>
  <li>- AND 
      - OR
      - XOR :
            - IMP NOTE: When u XOR the same elememt it always gives 0, ie for any int a, a^a = 0
      - NOT : an integer is 4 byte in cpp, ie 32 bits
              not operator inverts the bits 0->1 , 1->0 
              Ex. 2- 10 
                  ~2=111111111111111111111111111111101

                Now to print: Compiler checks the last bit and finds it is negative, therefore it displays the 2's compliment

                    000000000000000000000000000000010
                                                  +  1
                    000000000000000000000000000000011 which is 3, so the compiler displays -3 as answer
 
      - SHIFT OPERATORS
            Note: when number is small left shifting is multiplying by 2, BUT for lager numbers like 
            010000000000000000000000000000010 , now left shifting to a bit will make it negative
<b>
            Note: For positive numbers always the padding is with 0's BUT for  negative numbers padding is compiler dependent</b>   
            also refer Conversion readme 
<br/>
<br/>
<b>
      Genral note: 
      -  an int/int always gives an int as answer </b>

      FOR LOOP FLOW: 
        - The initialization statement is executed first is and is executed only once per loop
        - The condition is checked 
        - The body is executed 
        - then updation statement is executed 
        - then condition is checked and so on.
