# Imp OOPs concept

## Encapsulation

- **Wrapping up data members and functions**

- **Fully encapsulated class** - all data members are private.
- not to be confused with abstraction. Encapsulation is **INFORMATION/DATA HIDING**. whereas **ABSTRACTION -> IMPLEMENTATION HIDING**


Advantages/ Application
- Data hiding, increase security
- if we wan, we can make the class read only (no setters, only getter)
- Code reuse
- **Unit testing**


## Inheritance

- class which inherits is subclass/child/derived class. And the class which is used to inherit is called parent class/super/base class

How to use (Dont forget **colon and Access modifier**)
```
class child_class: access_modifier parent_class {}
```
