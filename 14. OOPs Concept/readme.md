# OOPs Concept

- Its a type of programming technique/paradigm/style where the programming style revolves around object
- Object is a real world entity which has state/property and behaviour
- **Helps with readabilty, extensiblity, managebility**
- User defined datatype - class - its a template
- Object is an instance of class




Some IMP points to remember

- When we create a class the memory assigned to it will be the sum of all the memories of its properties **AND PADDING AND GREEDY ALLIGNMENT**.
- **If the class is empty class , the memory assigned to it will be 1 byte, which is used for identification**
- to include a file - 
```
#include "hero.cpp"
```
- to access the data member/propery (it should be public) we use dot operator '.' 
- getter used for returning the value/ reading
- setter used to modify the value, certain conditions can be used
