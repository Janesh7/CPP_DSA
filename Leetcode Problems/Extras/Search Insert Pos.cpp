// 35. Search Insert Position
// Easy


// Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

// You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
// Output: 2
// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
// Output: 1
// Example 3:

// Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
// Output: 4
 

// Constraints:

// 1 <= nums.length <= 104
// -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
// nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
// -104 <= target <= 104

class Solution {

public:

    int searchInsert(vector<int>& nums, int target) {

        int low = 0, high = nums.size()-1;

        // Invariant: the desired index is between [low, high+1]

        while (low <= high) {

            int mid = low + (high-low)/2;

            if (nums[mid] < target)

                low = mid+1;

            else

                high = mid-1;

        }

        // (1) At this point, low > high. That is, low >= high+1

        // (2) From the invariant, we know that the index is between [low, high+1], so low <= high+1. Follwing from (1), now we know low == high+1.

        // (3) Following from (2), the index is between [low, high+1] = [low, low], which means that low is the desired index

        //     Therefore, we return low as the answer. You can also return high+1 as the result, since low == high+1

        return low;

    }
