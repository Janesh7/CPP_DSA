# Recursion


- If a function calls itself directly or indirectly its called recursion

In better terms:


**If the solution of the bigger problem depends upon a smaller same problem then we use recursion**


- It can be represented in recursive function
- The last case of a recursive function is called **base case**


In recursion 2 things
- base case
- recursive function
