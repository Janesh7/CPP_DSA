# Linked List

- LINEAR, not contagious
- collection of nodes
- node - data & ptr(s) to the address of next node (or prev as well)

**WHY**

- In array we need to allocate some memory initialy only
- In case of dyanamic array vector, if we want to add an ele to a vector of size 5, then compiler will allocate an array of size 10, and copy all the ele, and this case is not optimal
- insertion deletion is hard as we have to shift elements 

Advantages of LL
- no memory wastage
- Dynamic
- easy insertion/deletion
- not contagious
- grow and shrink on runtime

TYPES:
- singly
- doubly
- circular
- doubly circular
