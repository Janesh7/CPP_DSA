// Painter's Partition Problem


// Problem Statement
// Suggest Edit
// Given an array/list of length ‘N’, where the array/list represents the boards and each element of the given array/list represents the length of each board. Some ‘K’ numbers of painters are available to paint these boards. Consider that each unit of a board takes 1 unit of time to paint.
// You are supposed to return the area of the minimum time to get this job done of painting all the ‘N’ boards under a constraint that any painter will only paint the continuous sections of boards.
// For Example :
// In the below figure where array/list elements are {2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3}.
// alt text

// A painter can paint blocks {5,6} or {1,5,6,2} together but not {2,5,6} or {5,6,3}.
// Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Constraints, Images )

// Sample Input 1 :
// 2
// 4 2
// 5 5 5 5
// 4 2
// 10 20 30 40
// Sample Output 1 :
// 10
// 60
// Explanation For Sample Input 1 :
// In the first test case, we can divide the boards into 2 equal-sized partitions, so each painter gets 10 units of the board and the total time taken is 10.


// In the second test case, we can divide the first 3 boards for one painter and the last board for the second painter.
// Sample Input 2 :
// 2
// 2 2
// 48 90
// 4 2
// 1 2 3 4
// Sample Output 2 :
// 90
// 6
